This week, we had three points on our agenda: discussing the proposal for the nomination of Charles for the Alexander von Humboldt Research Professorship, interviews that we gave for an article about our group in the Forum Magazin of the university, and representations part three. In part three Simone introduced us to his representations of our example  "Diese Woche bekomme ich einen Hund" (this week I'll get a dog) and versions of it in terms of vectors. We ran out of time discussing recurring topics in these discussions but will do so once the proposal is out of the door. Next week, we will dedicate our meeting to jointly work on the proposal to make it ship shape.
